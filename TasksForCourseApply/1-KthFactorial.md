# Kth Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by n!, is
the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example:

```
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

To make things more interesting, we want you to find the `kth` factorial of any
number `n`.

```
kth_factorial = (n!) * (n!) * (n!) ... k times
```

The interface of the function is `kth_factorial(k, n)`. Think about the
constraints of the types of input `k` and `n` parameters and the output of the
whole function.

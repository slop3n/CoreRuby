# Taylor Series

Because we know you love your calculus classes, we present you the final of our
_Y U GIVE US SOME MUCH MATH_ series with the, ahem, [Taylor series].

In mathematics, a [Taylor series] is a representation of a function as an
infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's
derivatives at a single point. It is common practice to approximate a function
by using a finite number of terms of its [Taylor series].

In particular, you can easily calculate common trigonometric functions. And
that's want we want you to do. Calculate [Sine] and [Cosine] using their
respective [Taylor series]. You can find them [here].

The interface for the [Sine] and [Cosine] functions should be `sine(x,
precision)` and `cosine(x, precision)`, where `precision` is the upper limit of
`n`. The higher the `precision` is, the better the approximation.
